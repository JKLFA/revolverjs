# Revolver.js

Revolver.js is a modular javascript library for building a content slider from scratch. Think of it as a boilerplate or framework for making your own slider, exactly the way you want it. But don't let that scare you, it's really easy, I promise!

## Dependencies

Revolver has 2 hard dependencies: [Lodash](http://lodash.com/) and [Bean](https://github.com/fat/bean). Lodash is used for merging option objects, looping over arrays, etc. The same stuff other projects use it for. Bean is used to handle events. You need to make sure you load both of them before Revolver.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Revolver is with [Bower](http://bower.io/), like so:

```
$ bower install revolverjs
```

[Bower](http://bower.io/) will also resolve all of Revolver's dependencies for you. If you are unfamiliar with it, I highly recommend you take a look!

Of course, you can still take the old fashioned approach and [download](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/archive/master.zip) and unzip it anywhere in your project. Just make sure you also do the same for Revolver's dependencies. :)

## Getting Started

If you are planning on building your own content slider, image rotator, ad rotator, etc. completely from scratch, all you need to do is install Revolver and start extending Revolver. However, if you are new to Revolver, it is highly recommended you take a look and some of the transitions that we have made to help you get started.

If you are not looking to build your own, or would rather use an existing transition as a starting point, please have a peak at the transitions that are already out there first and decide which is the best starting place for your project.
