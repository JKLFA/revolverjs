# Revolver.js

Revolver.js is a modular javascript library for building a content slider from scratch. Think of it as a boilerplate or framework for making your own slider, exactly the way you want it. But don't let that scare you, it's really easy, I promise!

## Dependencies

Revolver has 2 hard dependencies: [Lodash](http://lodash.com/) and [Bean](https://github.com/fat/bean). Lodash is used for merging option objects, looping over arrays, etc. The same stuff other projects use it for. Bean is used to handle events. You need to make sure you load both of them before Revolver.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Revolver is with [Bower](http://bower.io/).

```
$ bower install revolverjs
```

It will resolve all of Revolver's dependencies for you, no need to go and download those separately. If you are unfamiliar with it, I highly recommend you take a look!

Of course, you can still take the old fashioned approach and [download](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/archive/master.zip) and unzip it anywhere in your project. Just make sure you also do the same for Revolver's dependencies.

## Getting Started

If you are planning on building your own content slider completely from scratch, all you need to do is install Revolver.js and [start extending](http://revolverjs.com/docs.html#extending_revolver). However, if you are new to Revolver, it is highly recommended you take a look and some of the [transitions we have already made](http://revolverjs.com/examples.html) to help you get started.
