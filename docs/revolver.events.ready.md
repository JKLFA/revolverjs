# Ready

This is an event that is emitted after instantiation as soon as Revolver is completely setup and ready to go. You can register any number of callbacks for this event by passing them to the constructor as the [onReady](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/blob/master/docs/revolver.options.onready.md) option.
