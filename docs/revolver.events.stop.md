# Stop

This is an event that is emitted every time the [stop method](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/blob/master/docs/revolver.methods.stop.md) is executed. You can register any number of callbacks for this event by passing them to the constructor as the [onStop](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/blob/master/docs/revolver.options.onstop.md) option, or by passing it to the [on](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/blob/master/docs/revolver.methods.on.md) method after instantiation.
