# transitionComplete

This is an event that is emitted every time the transition animation has complete. You can register any number of callbacks for this event by passing them to the constructor as the [transition.onComplete](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/blob/master/docs/revolver.options.transition.oncomplete.md) option, or by passing it to the [on](https://github.com/revolverjs/revolverjs/edit/master/docs/revolver.methods.on.md) method after instantiation.
